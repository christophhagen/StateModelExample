# StateModel Example

This repository contains a small example app to demonstrate the use of [StateModel](https://github.com/christophhagen/StateModel), an easy-to-use model framework for Swift and SwiftUI.

The example demonstrates the creation of models (see `Item`),
the injection of a database into the SwiftUI hierarchy (`StateModelExampleApp`),
and the use of queries (see `SortedItemList`).
